While not much technical progress was made over winter break. I did spend time thinking about the direction I hoped this project would go in. I want to tell the viewers a story. I want people to feel a genuine, personal, connection to what we present. People need to understand that what we present could predict the death of a significant part of Vermont’s culture. While speaking with some peers of varying majors, I found that many suggested finding a way to merge our visualizations with something people would have a personal connection with; an interview as an example. We could find quotes and back up people’s observations and fears with our data. If we find we have time, it’s something I believe would really bring our project to the next level.

The above means for the coming weeks we need to complete our data cleaning and begin generating visualizations. In addition, we need to begin mapping out a full website design to give us enough time to think about how best to bring a personal, impactful, connection to our project. Currently, our timeline we created the previous semester is still accurate to the milestones we need to hit to complete the project in a way Victor and I will both be proud of. We have all our data, it’s now time to clean it. I’ll be creating a script to map the cities we have in our weather data with the counties in Vermont in the near future. Afterward, there is a lot of missing data values we’ll have to figure out how to deal with. That’s assuming the data that would be there is even useful.
