Since the writing of the previous blog post, I have been thinking about what Victor and I have accomplished in terms of research this semester and I have been proud. I remember when we chose this idea, we were unsure if this project was even viable. However, as of our last meeting with our capstone professor, I honestly believe we are at a point where we can say this project is attainable. Recently, both Victor and I felt rather defeated. About a month ago a paper was published that was extremely similar to what we’re trying to achieve, their paper was just on a larger scale. After reading through the paper a couple times, and speaking to our capstone advisor, I decided that paper doesn’t make our project a waste. The paper, which is about maple syrup production in North America, doesn’t even mention Vermont. 

Victor and I are feeling very good about our progress. We have a lot of great data, and plenty of quality resources available to us. We still need to find more specific data on production by location in Vermont. However, once we find that data I believe we are set to begin cleaning and analyzing what we’ve found. The only aspect of the project I still feel unsure about is the predictions. I’m worried that we won’t be able to generate accurate predictions as we may be oversimplifying what impacts maple syrup production. Hopefully by next semester, we will have found quality tools which are capable of generating quality predictions, and we can play around with generating predictions and verifying that the predictions follow the trends we find.
