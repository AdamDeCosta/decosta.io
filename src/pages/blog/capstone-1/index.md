As a Vermonter, I find no single trait more defining and unifying than our shared love for Pure Vermont Maple Syrup. Knowing after graduation that I'm moving south to Raleigh, North Carolina (cue Wagon Wheel), creating a capstone project relating to the most central aspect of my home and community feels the most poetic and satisfying way to say "Thank you for everything! Goodbye for now." This state has given me so much, and there is no way in good conscience I could leave without giving something in return.

Our idea was conceived just over a week ago by my capstone partner Victor Alves and I. We were sitting in Professor Betsy Allen-Pennebaker's office and brainstorming ideas for what to work on. I knew I wanted to work on something that might genuinely help people. Luckily, Victor did as well. So, while attending the brainstorming session we had been tossing ideas back and forth, and eventually landed on a project we both find important.

Victor and I want to create a website to help educate people about the maple syrup industry in Vermont. We want to analyze seasonal production, and analyze environmental factors to understand how the climate affects production, *has* affected production, and potentially predict how it *will* affect production. Climate change is becoming increasingly more dangerous and impactful each day. With this project, I hope we can help raise awareness of its impact on our local community.

The capacity to create such a project hangs heavily on the availability of quality data sources. Currently, I feel the development of the project is within reach. Our preliminary research has provided us with quality production data going back decades. I am still hunting for specific data describing production per zip code per year. Finding such data would permit us to visualize on a map, the changes in production per year. I am extremely excited to work on this project this year, and I hope, reader, that you continue to follow our progress.

Thanks for reading,

Sincerely, \
